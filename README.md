#Description :
 1)The web app was built in motive of visualizing the JSON Web Tree -- showing how keys, arrays, and values relate to each other in a visual way.
 2)Just create a basic JSON tree in textarea and visualize it in right panel.
 3) I have also attached the basic example for JSON tree to test the code:
 ``
 {
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Thiru",
    "address": { "city": "Chennai", "zip": "600001" },
    "phones": ["+91-98xxxxxxx", "+91-99xxxxxxx"]
  },
  "items": [
    { "id": "a1", "name": "Item A", "price": 9.99 },
    { "id": "b2", "name": "Item B", "price": 19.5 }
  ],
  "active": true
}
``
