# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is enabled on this template. See [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) for more information.

Note: This will impact Vite dev & build performances.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# JSON-Tree-Visualizer
The web app was built in motive of visualizing the JSON Web Tree -- showing how keys, arrays, and values relate to each other in a visual way.
#Description :
 1)The web app was built in motive of visualizing the JSON Web Tree -- showing how keys, arrays, and values relate to each other in a visual way.
 2)Just create a basic JSON tree in textarea and visualize it in right panel.
 3) I have also attached the basic example for JSON tree to test the code:
 ``
 {
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Thiru",
    "address": { "city": "Chennai", "zip": "600001" },
    "phones": ["+91-98xxxxxxx", "+91-99xxxxxxx"]
  },
  "items": [
    { "id": "a1", "name": "Item A", "price": 9.99 },
    { "id": "b2", "name": "Item B", "price": 19.5 }
  ],
  "active": true
}
